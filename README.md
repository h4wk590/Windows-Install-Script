# Windows-Install-Script
Uses WinGet to automate the installation of my commonly used applications.

This script will install WinGet from the Official Microsoft Github Repo.


To add or remove programs - in main.ps1 add/remove `@{name = "Application.Name" }` to the array.

https://winget.run/ is a great site to search WinGet packages without installing it.
